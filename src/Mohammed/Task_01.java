     Task 1: Write a Java method to calculate the factorial of a given number.
A factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or
equal to n. It's denoted by n!.
 For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

Requirements:

The method should take an integer as input and return its factorial.
Consider edge cases, such as the factorial of 0.
Handle any potential exceptions or errors gracefully.
