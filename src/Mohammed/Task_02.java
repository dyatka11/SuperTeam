     Good job!!! Here is the second one for you. Write a task for me too in my folder under the
     task_01 =)

    You are given an array of integers, and your task is to write a method to find the second-highest number in the array.

Requirements:

The method should take an array of integers as input and return the second-highest number.
Consider edge cases, such as an array with all elements being the same or an array with less than two elements.
Aim for efficiency in your solution.
For example, if the input array is [3, 5, 6, 8, 2], the output should be 6 since it's the second-highest number in the array.
